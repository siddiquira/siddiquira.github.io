I'm currently a postbaccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA) fellow in the Section on Critical Brain Dynamics led by [Dietmar Plenz](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/dietmar-plenz), where been applying machine learning methods to analyze two-photon calcium imaging data and holographic optogenetic perturbations. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2024 where I studied Neuroscience and did research with [Michael Mauk](https://neuroscience.utexas.edu/directory/michael-mauk) on information processing in the cerebellum using large-scale computer simulations. 

I'm still working on this website.
