These are some selected research projects that have resulted in something tangible and/or that I really enjoyed.

## __Machine learning analyses of optogenetic perturbations in mouse V1__ 

Something will appear here eventually.

## __Recurrent neural networks with diverse intrinsic timescales__ 

Something will also appear here eventually.

## __Instability driven by partial relaxation of zero-row-sum constraints in random networks__

      The Eigenvalue Value (in Neuroscience) by Georgia Christodoulou and Tim Vogels helped me with this project and is a good read, but I had trouble finding it when I looked for it so [here](pdfs/christodoulou_vogels_2022.pdf) it is.
