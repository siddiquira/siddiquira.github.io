These are some selected research projects that have resulted in something tangible and/or that I really enjoyed.

#### Machine learning analyses of optogenetic perturbations in mouse V1

Something will appear here eventually.

#### Recurrent neural networks with diverse intrinsic timescales

#### Instability driven by partial relaxation of zero-row-sum constraints in random networks

    Numerical results for the distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane for N = 1000.  
    (a) If excitatory and inhibitory elements are drawn from distributions with different means but the same variance, a few eigenvalues lie outside the unit circle.  
    (b) When every row of the matrix individually sums to zero, the eigenvalues lie inside the unit circle.

The <em>Eigenvalue Value (in Neuroscience)</em> by Georgia Christodoulou and Tim Vogels helped me with this project and is a good read, but I had trouble finding it when I recently looked for it again so 
[here](/pdfs/christodoulou_vogels_2022.pdf) it is.
