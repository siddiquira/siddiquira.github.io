These are some selected research projects that have resulted in something tangible and/or that I really enjoyed.

# Machine learning analyses of optogenetic perturbations in mouse V1

Something will appear here eventually.

# Recurrent neural networks with diverse intrinsic timescales

Something will also appear here eventually.

# Instability driven by partial relaxation of zero-row-sum constraints in random networks

      The Eigenvalue Value (in Neuroscience) by Georgia Christodoulou and Tim Vogels helped me with this project and is a good read, but I had trouble finding it when I looked for it so <a href="/pdfs/christodoulou_vogels_2022.pdf">here</a> it is.
